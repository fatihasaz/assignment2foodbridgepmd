The development of a mobile application that is both functional and engaging is essential in the current digital environment to guarantee a positive user experience. The front-end development of a mobile application is the primary focus of this project, with an emphasis on the creation of a visually enticing and seamless user interface (UI). Our goal is to develop a user interface that surpasses the specifications specified in the case study provided, thereby improving user satisfaction and interaction.
The objective is to create a thorough layout that includes a minimum of five distinct screens, each of which is designed to facilitate critical user interactions, using industry-standard tools such as XML and Android Studio.. The primary screen will function as the central hub, while supplementary displays will direct users through a variety of functionalities and features in accordance with the case study's specifications.
In order to guarantee the application's efficacy, we will prioritise numerous design requirements as we commence this project. Our design will be optimised to adapt gracefully across various device screen sizes and orientations, as responsiveness is paramount. Another fundamental component of our strategy will be usability, which will prioritise intuitive controls, such as buttons and input fields and distinct navigation pathways to facilitate users' effortless interaction with the application. Finally, we will ensure that the visual experience is visually harmonious by consistently utilising colours, style, and layout to maintain a cohesive aesthetic.
In conclusion, the objective of this project is to establish a standard for quality and innovation in mobile development by providing a focus on users and robust mobile application UI that not only aligns with the enumerated objectives but also sets a new standard.

SOLUTIONS
1. UI Layout Issues on Different Screen Sizes
To address this issue, we replaced basic LinearLayouts and RelativeLayouts with ConstraintLayout, which offers more flexible and adaptive UI control. We also wrapped certain layouts in a ScrollView to allow vertical scrolling on smaller screens, preventing content from being clipped. Finally, we tested the app on several virtual devices with different screen sizes to ensure that the interface remained responsive and user-friendly across all devices.
2. Navigation Between Screens
We learned to implement navigation using explicit Intents, which allowed us to clearly define the destination Activity and pass relevant data using Bundles. To avoid crashes, we ensured that all target activities were correctly declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Online resources, such as official Android documentation and YouTube tutorials, were extremely helpful in guiding us through proper implementation.
3. Inconsistent Styling Across Screens
To improve consistency, we reviewed the styling used across all screens and made adjustments to ensure a more uniform look. We reused similar font sizes, colors, and button designs by manually applying the same values where needed. We also referred to design guidelines to help keep the layout clean and user-friendly. While we didnâ€™t use advanced theming tools, simply being mindful of repeating a consistent style throughout the app helped create a more cohesive and professional appearance.
